## 1. About
FilterIt was developed as a prototype implementation for a content filter to demonstrate
the usage of a filter on a platform like youtube.
The restful nodeJS server doesn't actually do any real filtering as promised, but can be easily extended.

>This project was started on the Insurathon 2018 by SparkassenVersicherungen in Stuttgart Germany (a Hackathon).

## 2. Architecture
The frontend part is mainly a VueJS SPA using a dropzone package and Vuetify as a UI Component Library.
The backend is a node-js server with a restful api.
The FilterIt needs the node server to run in order to function correctly.
